# Heart Disease Classification

A machine learning project that predicts the presence of heart disease using patient health data.  
This repository demonstrates a full ML workflow â€” from data preprocessing to model evaluation and saving.

## Project Overview

The goal is to build a **binary classifier** that predicts whether a patient has heart disease.  

### Key Steps:
- Data loading & preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Train/Test Split for unbiased evaluation  
- Model Training: Random Forest & Logistic Regression  
- Hyperparameter Tuning with RandomizedSearchCV  
- Performance Evaluation: precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, classification report  
- Model Saving using Joblib  

This project is designed to be beginner-friendly for anyone learning supervised ML in Python.
